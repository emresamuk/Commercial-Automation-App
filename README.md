## Additional Information
This project was created as a learning experience to develop a comprehensive management system using C# and DevExpress. It serves as a foundation for more complex systems and showcases the integration of various modules in a single application.
I developed the project in Turkish, so the file names might be in Turkish as well. Please keep this in mind if you decide to download and test it. Have a nice coding! :)
